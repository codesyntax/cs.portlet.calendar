Introduction
============

A calendar portlet using fullcalendar.io

It provides several options to customize, such as:

* Base path to search for events

* Base URL to generate links to

* View name to be appended to the base URL to generate links.


This way you can do basic overriding of the calendar.

It also provides a view that returns events in JSON, that way the fullcalendar
is more flexible and faster when rendering events.
